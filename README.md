### Current Projects

## LLM Application

This application is an intuitive, user-friendly tool that enables users to utilize the powerful capabilities of GPT-4. It provides a secure sign-in process through email authentication and magic links, offering a personalized experience for each user. The application can accommodate a variety of user needs and scenarios thanks to its flexible prompt template editing feature.

Designed with a social aspect in mind, the application allows users to share their creative outputs under a public profile, fostering a sense of community and interaction. This unique blend of AI content generation and social engagement positions our platform as a Social ChatGPT application, bringing a new dimension to user engagement, content creation and possibilities for the future.

2. In the application's chat setting, users can tailor the output to their needs. Once the joke, or any template-prompted content, is generated with user inputs, the final result is displayed.

3. Finally, the user can view both the request with all inputs and the generated joke.
